# Crime-Data-Analysis
Crime is an integral aspect of our society; whether as a victim or an offender, everyone has been witness to a crime. In our project, we analyzed crime data, and I have chosen the "Chicago Criminal dataset report," which contains crime episodes in Chicago from 2001 to the present. We looked at crime patterns over time, crime hotspots.


# Note : 
This Project is done using Google Bigquery and report is made on google data studio
all the tables are uploaded and the final report / graphes are also attached in form of a pdf. Please refer them
