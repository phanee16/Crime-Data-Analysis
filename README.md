# Crime-Data-Analysis
Crime is an integral aspect of our society; whether as a victim or an offender, everyone has been witness to a crime. In our project, we analyzed crime data, and I have chosen the "Chicago Criminal dataset report," which contains crime episodes in Chicago from 2001 to the present. We looked at crime patterns over time, crime hotspots.

Utilized Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery to analyze Chicago crime data.
Explored crime patterns and trends in Chicago using various queries and data analysis techniques.
Gained insights into the types of crimes, their frequency, geographical distribution, and temporal variations to inform decision-making and resource allocation for crime prevention efforts.
